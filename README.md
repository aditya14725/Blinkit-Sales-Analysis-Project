# Blinkit Sales Analysis 

This project presents a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard for Blinkit, developed using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes key sales metrics and trends across different outlets, products, and regions, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize performance and customer satisfaction.

# Objectives
* Provide clear insights into Blinkitâ€™s sales performance using interactive visualizations.

* Identify high-performing products, outlets, and customer trends.

* Enable data-driven strategies for improving sales and operational efficiency.

# Key Features
* Sales Performance: Track total sales, average sales per item, and comparison across time periods.

* Product Insights: View top-selling categories, analyze sales by item type (e.g., fruits, snacks, household).

* Customer Satisfaction: Gauge average rating per product and outlet.

* Geographical Analysis: Visualize sales distribution by outlet size (small/medium/large) and location (Tier 1/2/3 cities).

* Trend Analysis: Identify peak sales periods and growth trends.

* Custom Filtering: Explore data with slicers/filters for outlet type, item type, location, and other variables.
